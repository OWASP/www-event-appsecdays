  Title: "Attacking and Defending Containers and Kubernetes"
  URL: https://june.appsecdays.org/register/?id=sku_HOtd9tZbZM8NWp
  SectionId: sku_HOtd9tZbZM8NWp
  Description: "Organizations are rapidly moving towards microservice style architectures for their applications which 
    has led to container technology being implemented and taking over at a rapid rate.<br>
    Leading container technologies like Docker have risen in popularity and have been widely used because they have 
    helped package and deploy consistent-state applications across multiple environments. Container orchestration 
    technologies like Kubernetes help these deployments massively scale which can potentially increase the overall 
    attack-surface to a massive extent, if security is not given the attention required.<br>
    Security continues to remain a key challenge that both Organizations and security practitioners face with 
    containerized deployments.While containers continue to be vulnerable to security threats that plague any typical 
    application deployment, they also face specific security threats related to the containerization daemon, the shared 
    kernel and other shared resources like network, process and the filesystem. Serverless deployments face risks such as 
    insecure deployment configurations, inadequate monitoring and logging of functions, broken authentication, function 
    event data injection, insecure secret storage, and many more.<br>
    Attacking applications leveraging containers requires specific skill set and a deep understanding of their underlying 
    architecture.<br>
    This training is a practical approach with both Offensive and Defensive flavours making it ideal for security engineers, 
    red-teammers, devops engineers and developers with a plethora of hands-on exercises that have been designed from 
    real-world attacks and the security-specific challenges that we faced while implementing these technologies, helping 
    them test and implement security in a scalable manner.<br>
    The training consists of, but not limited to the following focus areas in Container and Kubernetes Security:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>Introduction to Container Technology</li>
    <li>Containerized Deployments and Container Orchestration Technologies</li>
    <li>Container Threat-Model</li>
    <li>Attacking Containers and Security deep-dive</li>
    <li>Introduction to Kubernetes</li>
    <li>Threat-Model of Orchestration technologies</li>
    <li>Attacking Kubernetes</li>
    <li>Kubernetes Defense-in-Depth</li>
    <li>Logging & Monitoring Orchestrated deployments</li>

  Description: "Developers often do not know what the common issues are with the framework they are using. At the same time, 
    most common frameworks ship with easy ways to shoot your application’s security in the foot. In this world we live in, developer 
    education will fail if even one mistake is made, which will expose a dangerous vulnerability. In this talk, we’ll show how you 
    can dramatically reduce the chance developers will shoot themselves in the foot by giving them safer versions of their common 
    tools so your company can ship more secure code.<br>
    We will write wrapper classes and safe versions of common tools to eliminate XSS vectors, open redirects, XXE, SSRF, LFI, and 
    other dangerous bugs in your codebase. After that we’ll show simple steps to educate developers and gain traction in your 
    organization. Then we’ll show how easy it is to integrate SAST tools in your CI/CD pipeline to ensure your developers use your 
    safe tools rather than the footguns built into common frameworks.<br>

  Title: API Attacks Beyond the OWASP API Top 10
  URL: https://july.appsecdays.org/register/?id=sku_HOtty6RFWsLTAd
  SectionId: sku_HOtty6RFWsLTAd
  Description: "Let’s face it, APIs are running the world.  3rd party integrations are everywhere from social media communication to integrations 
    allowing services to share platforms and data.  As developers race to create platforms with greater connectivity and functionality, shortcuts are 
    taken, errors are made, specifications ignore – resulting in the release of insecure APIs.  No longer are front end services and frameworks enough 
    to protect the APIs from new world, high-speed attacks.<br>
    Over the last 20 years as a hacker, researcher, and educator I have worked with many organizations to help them stop high-speed attacks as well as 
    sophisticated fraudsters that are constantly on the lookout for the next venue to ply their trade.  In addition to case studies derived from actual 
    attacks I will show how I was able to attack a garage door opener API and via responsible disclosure create a much safer platform for Chamberlain 
    customers/users to control entry into their homes.<br>
    In this 8-hour class we will talk about API attacks my company has seen against different types of platforms and compare common real-world attack 
    types to the API Top 10.<br>
    We will look at taking apart Android API calls, utilizing an open-source APK disassembly tool, for mobile applications and understand the attack 
    surface available.  This tool will be distributed via a docker container so students should have the ability to run a docker.<br>
    From a web application standpoint we will learn how to analyze API calls, API parameters and how to utilize simple tools like cURL or your favorite 
    intercept proxy, to make calls against APIs and understand the workflow to test against a range of use cases such as Account Take Over, Inventory 
    Take Over/Seat Spinning, Inventory Take Over, etc.<br>
    Attackers often have tools at their disposal that target specific organizations, we will highlight these tools and how they work.<br>
    Finally, we will look at some Case Studies from various places that we have seen attacks occur and current attack campaigns that have thwarted the 
    efforts of many security practitioners and development staff.  We will have a cloud environment built allowing for newly minted API security 
    enthusiasts to try techniques and view their attacks and fingerprints in real time."

  Description: "Have you experienced the challenge of communicating and collaborating with Compliance teams being as clear as mud?<br>
    We've all been there. In this training session, we'll learn how to use CNCF OPA (Open 
    Policy Agent) and Chef Inspec to verify the Compliance status of cloud resources 
    against standards such as Cloud Security Alliance CCM (Cloud Security Matrix) and AWS 
    Security Maturity Roadmap so we can help break some of the communication barriers with 
    Compliance teams, as they get an immediate understanding of the compliance status of 
    products and services.<br>
    Compliance is a major driver for investing in security for most businesses, and with 
    the growing number of systems and applications managing compliance of thousands of 
    systems without automation is not practical and Compliance teams are under immense 
    pressure to ensure successful audit outcomes, as failure to be compliant, can have 
    significant business impact. With Compliance as Code we can increase the speed of 
    delivery, mitigate lack of resources and time by-using checks across applications, 
    provide faster feedback to engineers, scale to hundreds or thousands of systems and 
    make the whole process easily auditable.<br>
    In this training, we will learn how to create and verify the compliance checks, 
    integrate them into CI/CD platform and also how we can leverage the use of metadata to 
    tag resources with all the compliance checks and standards they're meeting as we deploy 
    them in our cloud accounts in order to enable both engineering and compliance teams to 
    have the visibility they require for assurance of their cloud security posture.<br>
    The participants will perform all hands-on exercises in our state of the art browser 
    based labs."

  SectionId: sku_HOtwph5R3gBWJ0
  Description: "The world is constantly changing and way of doing activities are 
    continuously evolving. Earlier, injection was a word used to yield ‘remedy’ from 
    threats but in these modern times of predominantly ongoing cybercrimes, that’s the 
    same word causing ‘tragedy’ to people globally. One such grueling kind of it is the 
    topic that I’m going to brief out right here named as 'Server Side Template Injection.'<br>
    An injection attack that happens due improperly sanitization of user inputs through a 
    template at the server side is called SSTI. This injection attack is more dangerous 
    from both developer’s and security professional point of view as it can execute native 
    functions from the user defined template. An example of a malicious expression could 
    be {{system('whoami')}}, which will execute the whoami system command. Thus, this 
    template injection attack can even lead to a Remote Code Exploitation. Many times, 
    it can also compromise the entire web server.<br>
    Isn’t this attack a nightmare for developers and security professionals? Without a 
    doubt, it is!<br>
    Hence to caution people on this, my presentation will reveal you the wisdom on how 
    this attack works, the intensity of notoriety based on the various template types, 
    effective tips for preventing this attack and other such."

    unauthorized parties cannot access, modify, or delete this data. After all, the field 
    is called ‘Information Security’. However, data security is only one aspect of the 
    equation. If a database is breached, such as during the Equifax data breach of 2017, 
    not only data is compromised or stolen, but this data may be associated with people 
    (data privacy), and then regulations such as CCPA, PCI, HIPAA, and GDPR come into 
    place.<br> 
    Does your data security assessment include data privacy?<br>
    Attendees will come away with an understanding of how to combine data privacy impact 
    assessment (DPIA) methodology with data security assessment to produce a more rigorous

    organizations to find out the vulnerabilities in their environment of information systems and enable them 
    to fix those weaknesses before malicious hackers or adversaries may exploit their systems. This kind of 
    hacking is classified as White Hat Hacking. This course is formulated to make the students aware of various 
    hacking tools being used in the industry by cybersecurity professionals. The methodology of the course 
    covers more than 90% practical hands-on approach.<br>
    Learning Outcomes: Students will be able to distinguish ethical hacking from malicious hacking knowing the 
    concepts of White Hat and Black Hat hacking. They will get hands-on knowledge to perform the hacking tasks 
    in ethical ways to improve the security of assets by using various hacking tools.<br>
    <strong>Resources for hands-on approach:</strong><br>
    <ol>
    <li>Attack side: Kali Linux 2020.x, NMAP, Metasploit Framework (MSF).</li>
    <li>Victim side: Metasploitable, MS Windows 10, OWASP Resources i.e. Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) and buggy Web Application (bWAPP).</li>
    </ol>
    Note: The above resources will be installed and organized in a virtual environment i.e. Oracle VM 
    Virtualbox."

  Title: "Fuzzing: An effective alternative to code review and penetration testing"
  URL: https://august.appsecdays.org/register/?id=sku_HOuGOMSbuaiIro
  SectionId: sku_HOuGOMSbuaiIro
  Description: "Conducting an effective application penetration testing requires 
    specialized knowledge and experience. Penetration tests are costly and often only 
    considered at, or towards the end of any software development process. On the other 
    hand, most software companies and specially start-ups do not have any resources to 
    invest in source code reviews. These considered, if done correctly, fuzzing can 
    provide an effective alternative that can easily be included in any secure software 
    development process.<br>
    This course aims to provide a strong base to use fuzzing as an effective alternative 
    to discover vulnerabilities. Attendees will gain usable knowledge on fuzzing, learn 
    to build an effective wordlist, use Python to build application specific fuzzing tools 
    and see use cases to discover OWASP TOP 10 vulnerabilities using fuzzing. The course 
    will also provide guidelines to include fuzzing in the software development process 
    and the possible use of machine learning and baseline analysis to enrich returns from 
    fuzzing."

  Title: "Secure By Design: Threat Modeling For Developers"
  URL: https://august.appsecdays.org/register/?id=sku_HOuKN2MC5W2mfv
  SectionId: sku_HOuKN2MC5W2mfv
  Description: "You’ve decided that your products require a higher level of security, and 
    now you need to start introducing security into your software design activities. But 
    with a focus on quick delivery, your team doesn't have much bandwidth to discuss 
    quality or security, let alone integrate heavyweight security activities into the 
    development workflow...<br> 
    *Threat Modeling* is one of the most effective security activities that can be 
    performed for a software application. Using a structured methodology for 
    security-based analysis of a complex system can help you identify and prioritize 
    potential threats and attack vectors, and understand the appropriate mitigations. A 
    good threat model is essential for a robust, secure design and architecture, and can 
    support mitigation of all relevant threats. This can also build customer confidence.<br>
    As a developer, you want to be empowered to contribute to the security design, and 
    take ownership of the security features in your products. With training and some 
    tangible experience, you could independently create the threat models for your 
    applications and design a more secure architecture, easing the load off your security 
    team, and creating deeper integration and a higher level of security than enforcing it 
    externally.<br>
    This Threat Modeling Workshop will kickstart your security design efforts, teach your 
    developers the skills required to build their own threat models for your products, and 
    train with actual hands-on experience so that you are confident to continue designing 
    secure products based on threat modeling."
